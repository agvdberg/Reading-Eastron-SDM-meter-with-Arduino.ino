# Reading Eastron SDM meter with Arduino.ino
 Part of the code to read an Eastron SDM energy meter with RS485 on an Arduino (MEGA)
 
 
 The code provided is an extract of my used code 
  - on an Arduino MEGA
  - with an RS485 device connected to 4 Eastron SDM Energy DIN-rail devices
  - and an LCD for debugging
  
 The complete code is stripped to show only the reading of 1 SDM-device and no other components
 (to make the code more simple and readable)
